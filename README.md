# Hello-World

Hello, i’m a self taught coder who got his start working on  a UDK game called Iggy’s Egg Adventure which is for sale now on steam.

But UDK uses a proprietary language called UnrealScript so i needed to learn something different. I found out about HackerRank through LaunchCode and started learning C++.

After meeting with LaunchCode i started learning C# by developing small games in Unity. I Followed Tutorials and then changed, expanded, or combined them in some way.
